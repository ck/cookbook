h2. Cookbook Application

This application we're creating in this document serves two purposes. 
First is demonstrates the use of MerbAuth slices in a Merb-based application. Second, it acts as a test harness for updates to the used gems and slices.

h2. Overview

This document describes the steps to create a simple cookbook application using the following, best-of-bread tools:

* Merb
* DataMapper
* HAML
* RSpec
* MerbAuth

Disclaimer: The main purpose is to show the use of MerbAuth and its slices and not the modeling of an application!

h2. Preparation

First, let us install all necessary gems.
                                         
TODO describe the steps.

h2. Steps

h3. Skeleton App

Create the skeleton

@$ merb-gen app cookbook --orm datamapper  --template-engine haml  --testing-framework rspec@

@$ cd cookbook@


Next we adjust the dependencies in the @config/init.rb@ file. Comment out listed dependencies and add other ones:

<pre><code>
	# dm-more dependencies
	dependency 'dm-timestamps'
	dependency 'dm-types'
	dependency 'dm-serializer'
	dependency 'dm-validations'
	
	# merb-more dependencies
	dependency 'merb-action-args'
	dependency 'merb-assets'
	dependency 'merb-builder'
	dependency 'merb-cache'
	dependency 'merb-haml'
	dependency 'merb-jquery'
	dependency 'merb-mailer'
	dependency 'merb-slices'
	
	# merb-plugins dependencies
	dependency 'merb_helpers'
	dependency 'merb_param_protection'
</code></pre>

In order to define the connection to the database we have two options

# established the database connection in the environment files
# define the database connection parameters in a separate configuration file

We will use the old fashion method and use the @config/database.yml@ file. Create the file and define the connection parameters (adjust to your environment as needed):

<pre><code>
	---
	:development: &defaults
	  :adapter: mysql
	  :database: cookbook_development
	  :username: cb_user
	  :password: secret
	  :host: localhost
	
	:test:
	  <<: *defaults
	  :database: cookbook_test
	
	:production:
	  <<: *defaults
	  :database: cookbook_production
	
	:rake:
	  <<: *defaults
</code></pre>


Refer to your database manual on create the database.

Since we use thread-safe DataMapper as our ORM we can also turn the mutex off in the @Merb.config@:

<pre><code>
	Merb::Config.use do |c|
	
		...
	
		c[:use_mutex] = false
	end
</code></pre>

That's it for setup. We have an application that has no models, no controllers, and no views. In sort: that does nothing!
