h2. Cookbook Application

This application we're creating in this document serves two purposes. 
First is demonstrates the use of MerbAuth slices in a Merb-based application. Second, it acts as a test harness for updates to the used gems and slices.

h2. Overview

This document describes the steps to create a simple cookbook application using the following, best-of-bread tools:
